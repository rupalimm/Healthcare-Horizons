Large granular urea is widely used as a high-efficiency nitrogen fertilizer due to its slow-release properties, which enhance nutrient uptake by crops. In agriculture, it helps to boost crop yields by supplying essential nitrogen to the soil, which is crucial for plant growth and development. This form of urea minimizes nitrogen losses through volatilization and leaching, making it a preferred choice for farmers looking to improve their productivity sustainably. Additionally, large granular urea's uniform size and slow dissolution rate make it suitable for application in various soil types and farming conditions, further contributing to its popularity in the agricultural sector.</p><p>Besides agriculture, large granular urea finds applications in industrial processes and in the production of resins and chemicals. In industrial applications, it is used as a raw material in the manufacture of urea-formaldehyde resins, which are essential for producing adhesives, laminates, and coatings. The robust properties of large granular urea make it ideal for these processes due to its consistency and efficiency in chemical reactions. Furthermore, it serves as a feedstock in the production of other nitrogen-based chemicals and in various environmental applications, including wastewater treatment, where it acts as a source of nitrogen for biological processes. This versatility across different industries contributes to the strong demand and growth of the large granular urea market globally.</p></p><p id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of Reseach Report @ <a target="">https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=660288&utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=262</a></strong></p><h3 id="" class="">Who is the largest manufacturers of&nbsp;Large Granular Urea Market worldwide?</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>QAFCO</Li><Li> CF Industries</Li><Li> SABIC</Li><Li> Yangmei Chemical</Li><Li> Yara</Li><Li> Nutrien</Li><Li> Koch Fertilizer</Li><Li> EuroChem</Li><Li> Shanxi tianze coal-chemical</Li><Li> Rui Xing Group</Li><Li> China XLX Fertiliser</Li><Li> Shandong Lianmeng Chemical</Li><Li> Hualu-hengsheng</Li><Li> Dongguang Chemical</Li><Li> Sichuan Lutianhua</Li><Li> CVR Partners</Li><Li> LP</Li><Li> Hubei Yihua Chemical Industry</Li><Li> Luxi Chemical Group</Li><Li> Coromandel International Ltd.</Li><Li> Sinofert Holdings Limited.</Li><Li> Bunge Limited</Li><Li> OSTCHEM (Group DF)</Li><Li> OCI Nitrogen</h3><h3 id="" class="">Large Granular Urea Market &nbsp;Segments Analysis</h3><p id="" class="">Using a deliberate segmentation strategy, the Large Granular Urea Market research report provides an in-depth analysis of numerous market segments, including application, type, and location.
