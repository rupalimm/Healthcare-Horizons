In the residential segment, countertops are predominantly used in kitchens and bathrooms, where they play a crucial role in both functionality and aesthetics. Kitchen countertops, for instance, are designed to withstand daily wear and tear, and thus materials such as granite, quartz, and marble are popular due to their durability and ease of maintenance. Bathroom countertops, on the other hand, often focus on water resistance and style, with options like solid surfaces and engineered stones being favored for their ability to resist moisture and stains. The increasing trend of home renovation and the demand for customized and high-quality materials are driving the growth of this segment, as homeowners seek to enhance their living spaces with elegant and durable solutions.</p><p>In the commercial segment, countertops are used extensively in various sectors including hospitality, retail, and office spaces. In commercial kitchens, countertops must meet strict hygiene standards and are commonly made from materials like stainless steel, which offers both durability and ease of cleaning. Retail environments often require aesthetically pleasing and robust countertops to enhance customer experience, leading to a preference for materials such as quartz and high-pressure laminates. Office spaces also benefit from versatile and stylish countertops that contribute to a productive and appealing work environment.
